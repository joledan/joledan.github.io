I contributed to projects on globalization, COVID-19 vaccine supply, conflict and gender in India, and trade barriers in Latin America.\nI was a research specialist at the Empirical Studies of Conflict project at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, where I worked on projects related to conflict and COVID-19 misinformation.\nI have a MA in Economics (2019) focusing on Development Studies, and a BA in Economics and Geography (2018) from McGill University.
